🔍 DiabetIQ Insight is a binary classification project predicting diabetes likelihood based on users' health factors.

🛠 Implemented all classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and others.

🧬 Conducted rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal performance, achieving accuracy over 82%.

📊 Showcased the average data of each diabetes factor for users and their respective age groups, enhancing user understanding, and presented detailed performance metrics, confusion matrices, and model code for each classifier.

🌐 Developed a user-centric Flask web application to streamline diabetes likelihood prediction and deployed the project on Heroku(https://diabetiq-insight-53100b753a0a.herokuapp.com/) for wider accessibility.
